This code is a Python package that uses Psi4â€™s DETCI module to run Fock-space CI (RAS-nSF-IP/EA) calculations. 
The method handles spin and spatial degeneracies in molecular systems by solving the orbitals of a reference state 
that can be well-represented by a single determinant, and then using non-particle-conserving and non-spin-conserving 
operators to obtain the desired state.
